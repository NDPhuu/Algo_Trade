# Algorithmic Trading with Python
## Equal weight VN30
- Equal weight is a proportional measure that gives the same importance to each stock in a portfolio or index fund, regardless of a company's size.
- Equal Weight VN30 in algorithmic trading is used to diversify portfolios and balance risk
- This will help us reduce dependence on large companies, increased profit opportunities from smaller stocks
- By using python lib `vnstock3`, it's easy to access the data without an API call
## Quantitative Value Strategy
- "Value investing" means investing in the stocks that are cheapest relative to common measures of business value (like earnings or assets).
- For this project, I'm going to build an investing strategy that selects the 10 stocks from VN30 with the best value metrics. Then, calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 10 stocks.
